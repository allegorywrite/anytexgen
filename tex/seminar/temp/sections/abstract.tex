\abstract{%
In this seminar, I propose a distributed Control Barrier Function (CBF) framework on SE(3) that guarantees shared fields of view for cooperative self-localization. In multi-agent systems, maintaining a common viewing volume is essential to enhance the accuracy of cooperative self-localization via feature-point matching. Our approach formulates safety constraints for the tracking of both single and multiple feature points, employing probabilistic CBFs to enforce field-of-view sharing. To address nonholonomic drone dynamics, we introduce High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) and cast the problem as a constrained optimization that respects the discrete dynamics on SE(3). Finally, we present a fully distributed implementation based on the Primal-Dual Method of Multipliers (PDMM), which achieves field-of-view sharing without centralized coordination. Simulation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CBF design and the performance of its distributed implementation.
